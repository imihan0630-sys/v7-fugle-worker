## DL-002 — Pattern Maturity / Multi-stage K-line Structure

### Research question
Can explicit multi-stage chart morphology add incremental selection value beyond the current Formal A/B structure, especially by identifying high-quality setups that are still maturing before a classic breakout or pullback-entry condition becomes fully eligible?

### Evidence retained
- Lo, Mamaysky & Wang (Journal of Finance, 2000): chart patterns can be converted from subjective visual ideas into systematic pattern-recognition rules; several patterns such as double-bottoms carried incremental information in a large U.S. sample. Use this as evidence that morphology is researchable, not as proof that every named pattern works.
- Lu (Pacific-Basin Finance Journal, 2014): Taiwan stock daily OHLC data from 1992-2009 found four single-line candlestick patterns profitable after transaction costs, bootstrap, out-of-sample and sub-sample checks. Trend context matters and many candlestick patterns did not work.
- Lu, Shiu & Liu (Review of Financial Economics, 2012): on Taiwan 50 components, Piercing, Bullish Engulfing and Bullish Harami were the profitable bullish two-day reversal patterns in the tested sample; bearish reversals were weaker. Transaction costs and robustness checks were included. Pattern profitability still depends on trend definition and holding strategy.
- Wang & Chan (Expert Systems with Applications, 2007): bull-flag template matching was tested on NASDAQ and Taiwan Weighted Index, supporting formalization of continuation geometry.
- Fidelity Cup-with-Handle guidance: prior advance, rounded cup, right-side recovery, handle near upper half, limited handle retracement, handle volume dry-up, and increased breakout volume are measurable morphology components. Cup duration is commonly multi-week to multi-month, so a 20-day-only resistance view can be too local.
- Fidelity Double-Bottom guidance: two troughs alone are not confirmation; the middle peak/neckline must be broken.
- Sakata Five Methods are retained as a historical taxonomy (Three Mountains, Three Rivers, Three Gaps, Three Soldiers, Three Methods), but should be decomposed into measurable OHLC/sequence features rather than treated as standalone truth.

### Current-system comparison
Current Formal already uses meaningful K-line structure:
- MA20/MA60 trend and bullish stack
- priorHigh20 and recent highs
- pullbackPct and supportDistancePct
- volumeTodayVsPrev5 and 5-to-20-day volume contraction
- daily close position and upper-shadow ratio
- ATR / volatility
- ret20 / late-stage checks
- A pullback and B breakout gates

The likely incremental gap is topology and lifecycle:
- no explicit swing-leg segmentation
- no contraction sequence/count
- no base duration
- no cup roundness or rim symmetry
- no handle location/depth
- no neckline topology
- no flag pole/channel geometry
- no explicit pre-breakout maturity state
- no continuous pattern-fit confidence
- no failed-pattern lifecycle

### Pattern maturity lifecycle
Use a generic state machine:
FORMING -> STRUCTURE_VALID -> MATURE_PRE_BREAKOUT -> PIVOT_READY -> BREAKOUT_CONFIRMED -> RETEST_CONFIRMING -> FAILED

Central hypothesis: a continuous maturity state may preserve useful information that a binary A/B pass/fail gate loses.

## DL-002 feature families

### VCP / progressive contraction
Research fields:
- contractionCount
- contractionDepthPct[]
- contractionDurationDays[]
- depthMonotonicity
- durationMonotonicity
- higherLowRatio
- volumeDryUpSlope
- finalTightnessPct
- finalTightnessATR
- pivotPrice
- pivotDistancePct
- breakoutRangeExpansion
- breakoutVolumeRatio
- trendContext

Important rule: use non-overlapping swing legs. Overlapping rolling windows such as 5d/10d/20d can mechanically appear to shrink and create false VCPs.

### Cup / Cup-with-Handle
Research fields:
- priorAdvancePct
- cupDurationDays
- cupDepthPct
- bottomRoundnessScore
- leftRightRimDiffPct
- rightSideRecoveryPct
- handleDurationDays
- handleDepthPct
- handlePositionInCup
- handleVolumeDryUp
- pivotPrice
- pivotDistancePct
- breakoutVolumeRatio

Lifecycle:
CUP_FORMING -> RIGHT_SIDE_RECOVERY -> HANDLE_FORMING -> HANDLE_TIGHT -> PIVOT_READY -> BREAKOUT_CONFIRMED -> FAILED

### Double-bottom / W-bottom
Research fields:
- leftLow / rightLow
- troughSimilarityPct
- bottomSpacingDays
- necklinePrice
- necklineHeightPct
- rightLowVsLeftLowPct
- secondBottomVolumeRatio
- undercutAndReclaim
- reclaimSpeedDays
- necklineBreakoutVolumeRatio

Do not assume “right foot higher” is automatically superior. Test separately:
A. right low higher than left
B. approximately equal lows
C. slight undercut followed by rapid reclaim

### Flag / Pennant / Platform
Research fields:
- poleReturnPct
- poleDurationDays
- consolidationDepthPct
- consolidationDurationDays
- channelSlope
- rangeCompressionSlope
- volumeDryUpSlope
- distanceToPriorHighPct
- breakoutVolumeRatio
- trendContext
- failedBreakoutWithin3D / within5D

### Candlestick / Sakata-derived sequence features
Use as contextual confirmation, not standalone strategies:
- real-body size normalized by ATR
- upper/lower wick ratio
- body overlap / engulfing ratio
- gap size
- close position
- sequence direction count
- volume confirmation
- prior trend state
- location versus support/resistance

Taiwan-specific first priorities: Piercing, Bullish Engulfing, Bullish Harami. This is a research priority only, not a claim that their historical edge persists in 2026.

## DL-002A — Repaint-safe Swing Segmentation

### Why this is foundational
VCP, W-bottom, cup/handle, flags and neckline structures all depend on local highs/lows. A conventional ZigZag can relocate the latest pivot after future prices arrive. A historical backtest that treats the final pivot date as though the pivot was known at that date leaks future information.

### Research rule
Every swing point must store:
- pivotAt: bar where the local extreme occurred
- confirmedAt: first later bar where the reversal rule made that pivot knowable

At decision date t:
- use a confirmed swing only if confirmedAt <= t
- never backdate information to pivotAt
- last forming leg can be PROVISIONAL but cannot be treated as confirmed historical structure

### Method direction
Directional-change research supports event-based swing confirmation after price reverses from an extremum by a pre-specified threshold. Recent trend-structure work also distinguishes event occurrence from confirmation. Practical ZigZag documentation explicitly warns that the latest pivot can redraw until confirmed.

Preferred first research design:
- use volatility/ATR-normalized directional-change segmentation instead of one fixed percentage across all stocks
- pre-register a small multi-scale family (MICRO / BASE / MAJOR)
- do not optimize the thresholds on future returns
- pattern detectors consume confirmed swing hierarchies, not arbitrary overlapping windows

### Additional current-system gap
Current B qualification is mainly anchored to priorHigh20, while longer resistance information exists elsewhere. Cup-with-handle and W-bottom structures can span far beyond 20 sessions. Therefore a 20-day breakout may be only a local breakout below an older rim/neckline, and a mature long base may be poorly described by the 20-day window.

Research comparison:
- priorHigh20
- priorHigh60
- swing-derived 40/60/120-day structural resistance
- pattern-specific rim/neckline/pivot

Do not replace priorHigh20 automatically; measure the incremental value first.

### Pattern-state integrity fields
Every detected pattern should store:
- patternFamily
- state
- stateAsOf
- pivot/reference levels known as of stateAsOf
- source swings with pivotAt + confirmedAt
- provisionalLegUsed
- noLookaheadVerified

A later successful breakout must never upgrade an earlier historical date after the fact.

## Bias / overfit controls
- Freeze definitions before inspecting future outcomes.
- Pattern state at date t uses only bars known through t.
- Pre-breakout maturity and post-breakout confirmation are distinct labels.
- No historical Shadow fabrication.
- Use walk-forward / non-overlapping out-of-sample blocks and date-clustered evaluation.
- Compare within the same scan date where possible; control for market regime, liquidity, price tier and sector.
- Evaluate incremental value after controlling for current Formal features rather than raw standalone win rate.
- Correct for multiple pattern tests / Factor Zoo risk.
- Include transaction costs and slippage in trading-rule experiments.
- Keep Selection Alpha separate from Execution Alpha.

## Validation design
Cohorts:
- Formal SELECTED
- Near-miss
- Rejected / Control

Outcomes:
- D1 / D3 / D5 / D10
- MFE / MAE
- stop-first rate
- breakout failure within 3D / 5D
- time-to-pivot / time-to-entry
- entry-zone reach
- zero-pick / capital-utilization impact for Shadow supplement only

Core comparisons:
1. Pattern-strong Near-miss vs pattern-weak Near-miss on same date.
2. Pattern-strong Rejected vs matched rejected controls.
3. Formal SELECTED with high pattern maturity vs without it.
4. Incremental effect after controlling ret20, ATR, volume contraction, breakout quality, support distance, Residual RS, overheat and DL-001 Information Discreteness.
5. Regime splits.

## Status
WORTH_SHADOW_RESEARCH.
No Formal Core, ranking, thresholds, capital, execution, monitoring or push change is approved or implied.

## Exact next continuation point
1. Compare directional-change segmentation versus fixed-window local-extrema segmentation for stability and confirmation lag.
2. Pre-register a small ATR-normalized multi-scale swing family; do not tune thresholds to outcomes.
3. Define VCP on non-overlapping confirmed swing legs and use a confidence score, not a single binary rule.
4. Define cup/handle topology on multi-month horizons and compare its rim/pivot with priorHigh20/priorHigh60.
5. Define W-bottom neckline lifecycle and the three right-low variants.
6. Quantify Taiwan candlestick formulas for Piercing, Bullish Engulfing and Bullish Harami after trend/ATR/volume normalization.
7. Map all DL-002 features against current Formal features and remove redundant variables before any coding proposal.
8. Freeze definitions, then validate same-date SELECTED / Near-miss / Rejected with D1/D3/D5/D10, MFE/MAE, stop-first and failure rates.
