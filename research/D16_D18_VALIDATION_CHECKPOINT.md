## Scope
This checkpoint owns D16 statistical validation and D18 regime × strategy interaction. It does not duplicate domain-specific factor research.

## 2026-09-28 synthesis — validation architecture frozen

### 1. Regime is an as-of covariate, not an ex-post story
A regime label is admissible only when every input has marketDate / observedAt / availableAt / source / PIT eligibility and the label can be replayed from information available at the decision clock. Historical labels reconstructed with later classification, revised data, future transition knowledge, or current industry membership are not OOS evidence.

### 2. Regime × strategy needs two separate estimands
- Attribution estimand: how a frozen strategy performed conditional on a PIT-safe regime.
- Policy estimand: whether changing activation/weight because of that regime improves outcomes after costs versus the same frozen strategy without switching.
Good attribution does not imply a useful switching policy.

### 3. Switching policy must pay a hysteresis tax
Any activation/deactivation or dynamic weighting rule must measure transition delay, false transitions, churn/whipsaw, opportunity cost, turnover/slippage and UNKNOWN coverage. A regime rule that looks better only because it uses same-day final state before the strategy decision is look-ahead contaminated.

### 4. Walk-forward protocol frozen before outcomes
For any D18 strategy-policy hypothesis:
1. Freeze regime taxonomy and input contract.
2. Freeze decision clock and strategy version.
3. Train/calibrate only on prior eligible dates.
4. Purge training dates whose D+N outcome overlaps the next holdout boundary.
5. Test the next untouched block; no threshold retuning inside holdout.
6. Roll forward and repeat.
7. Aggregate by independent scan date, not stock rows.
8. Report UNKNOWN/coverage and regime occupancy.
9. Compare static strategy vs regime-conditioned policy after identical costs.
10. Run leave-one-date / leave-one-regime sensitivity where sample size permits.

### 5. Minimum falsification matrix
Every claimed interaction must survive:
- static-strategy baseline;
- same strategy with shuffled/permuted regime labels within PIT-safe blocks as a negative control;
- date-cluster sensitivity;
- transaction-cost/slippage stress;
- regime prevalence/coverage check;
- factor redundancy check against trend, volatility, breadth, sector RS and stock-level signals;
- transition-only exclusion sensitivity;
- no single regime/year/sector/date may dominate the conclusion.

Permutation is a research negative control, not a source of synthetic market history; temporal dependence must be preserved by block/date permutation rather than arbitrary stock-row shuffling.

### 6. Current data limitations
System 2 Market Regime V0 already freezes useful PIT semantics for trend, participation, liquidity, concentration, sector observation, institutions and volatility, but large-cap vs small-cap leadership remains UNKNOWN until a PIT-safe size-bucket contract exists; global/macro remains UNKNOWN until durable receipt contracts exist. Therefore D18-06 and parts of D18-07 cannot advance to L2/L3 from inference alone.

R06 transition research also has a session-continuity constraint: adjacent observed research dates are not necessarily adjacent official trading sessions. GAP_UNKNOWN must remain UNKNOWN; missing dates cannot be silently bridged.

### 7. Shadow cohort warning
Current bounded/reason-ordered rejected cohorts and first-failure semantics can bias counterfactual estimates. Regime interaction studies must not treat bounded Shadow membership as a representative rejected universe. D16-13 remains evidence-infrastructure constrained until membership/population semantics are prospectively repaired.

## Module conclusions this round

### D18-08 Strategy activation/deactivation rules
Mechanism and falsification are now defined: activation rules are policy hypotheses, not descriptive regime labels. They require PIT-safe state, frozen decision clock, static baseline, hysteresis/transition-cost accounting, and walk-forward OOS. Status can advance conceptually from L1 to L2; no strategy activation is approved.

### D18-09 Dynamic strategy weighting
Dynamic weights are a stronger policy intervention than on/off gating and add degrees of freedom. First admissible test should use a tiny preregistered weight set or monotone mapping, not continuous optimizer tuning. Compare against equal/static weights and charge turnover. Conceptual L2 only; alpha UNKNOWN.

### D18-10 Multi-strategy correlation / Ensemble
Correlation must be measured on same-date strategy returns with missing-strategy days explicit; row-pooled stock correlation is not portfolio diversification evidence. Regime-conditioned correlation is secondary and requires enough independent dates per regime. Conceptual L2 only.

### D18-12 Drawdown-aware de-risking
A drawdown rule may reduce tail loss but is path-dependent and can mechanically buy low exposure after losses and miss recovery. Test against fixed-risk baseline with the drawdown state known before the next decision; include recovery opportunity cost and churn. Conceptual L2 only.

### D18-13 Regime performance attribution
Freeze strategy version and regime label before outcome; report both unconditional and conditional performance, regime occupancy, independent dates and uncertainty. Attribution alone cannot justify switching. Conceptual L2 only.

### D18-14 Walk-forward regime validation
Protocol above supplies mechanism + falsification + PIT/replay contract. Conceptual L2 only; L3 requires actual Taiwan PIT data feasibility for the full tested inputs and L4 requires prospective/OOS evidence.

## Overfitting controls added
- Every new regime threshold, transition persistence length, weighting map, cost assumption used for selection, or label taxonomy variant is a new experiment/version.
- Do not choose regimes because they maximize historical strategy spread.
- Prefer coarse interpretable states until evidence proves incremental value.
- Nested tuning is required if any hyperparameter selection is introduced; outer holdout stays untouched.
- Multiple strategies × regimes × horizons create a multiplicity family and must be registered together rather than cherry-picked.

## Optimization decision
FORMAL_OPTIMIZATION_CANDIDATE: NONE.
Reason: architecture/gates improved, but no mature prospective/OOS regime-policy evidence yet. No Formal Core or System 2 strategy weight/activation change is justified.


## 2026-09-28 deep falsification continuation — size/global/shadow contracts

### D18-06 PIT-safe large-cap vs small-cap leadership contract
A size-leadership state is admissible only if membership is frozen using information available at the regime decision clock. The preferred first contract is cross-sectional, date-relative and coarse rather than an outcome-tuned NT$ cutoff:
- universe = same frozen ordinary-share universe used for the market snapshot;
- size basis = PIT-safe market capitalization only;
- explicit market-cap source is preferred; sharesOutstanding × close is admissible only when sharesOutstanding has its own observedAt/availableAt/provenance and corporate-action denominator semantics;
- UNKNOWN source/vintage => UNKNOWN size membership, never imputed from current shares;
- freeze large/small buckets before observing subsequent strategy outcomes; preregister bucket construction and minimum eligible coverage;
- measure leadership using same-horizon aggregate/median returns of frozen buckets and keep liquidity/activity as separate covariates.

Critical falsification: existing market-cap-floor research shows size can proxy liquidity, limit-hit/limits-to-arbitrage and information quality. Therefore a raw large-minus-small return spread is not independent regime evidence. Any claimed strategy interaction must survive controls/matching for executable liquidity, price, volatility, limit state, information quality and sector composition. If the interaction disappears, D18-06 is redundant context rather than a strategy switch.

Do not infer size leadership from trade value, price level, index membership, or today's reconstructed market cap. Do not threshold-sweep bucket cutoffs after seeing outcomes.

Current status: CONTRACT_DEFINED / DATA_FEASIBILITY_PARTIAL. D18-06 remains below PIT-evidence promotion until a durable prospective market-cap vintage receipt exists with adequate coverage.

### D18-07 domestic risk state is not global risk-on/off
Freeze two distinct objects:
1. TAIWAN_DOMESTIC_RISK_CONTEXT: may use PIT-safe Taiwan trend, breadth/participation, liquidity/activity, concentration, institutions and realized volatility.
2. GLOBAL_TRANSMISSION_CONTEXT: remains UNKNOWN until durable receipts exist for each selected foreign index/FX/rate/commodity/macro input with source timestamp, observedAt, availableAt, Taiwan decision-clock alignment, holiday/session semantics and revision vintage where relevant.

A domestic weak tape must not be relabeled GLOBAL_RISK_OFF. Conversely, a US/global risk-off observation does not prove a Taiwan strategy gate unless the transmission adds OOS information beyond domestic trend/volatility/breadth and stock/sector factors.

Required negative controls:
- domestic-only baseline;
- global-only context;
- domestic + global incremental model;
- lagged global inputs aligned to what Taiwan knew at decision time;
- holiday/session mismatch exclusion;
- event-release revision/availability audit;
- identical cost treatment.

If global context adds no stable incremental OOS value, simplify/remove it rather than retaining narrative complexity.

Current status: SEMANTIC_SPLIT_FROZEN / GLOBAL_RECEIPTS_UNKNOWN.

### D16-13 Shadow population receipt for unbiased counterfactuals
A bounded or reason-ordered Shadow cohort cannot estimate the effect of regime gating unless inclusion probability/population semantics are known. Future counterfactual research needs a per-date population receipt frozen before outcomes:
- scanDate, strategyVersion, regimeVersion, universeVersion;
- eligiblePopulationCount and stable population hash/manifest reference;
- inclusion rule and cap;
- ordering key before truncation;
- sampled/included count;
- exclusion counts by reason;
- whether sampling is deterministic census, random sample, or top-K/reason-ordered;
- inclusion probability when probabilistic;
- UNKNOWN/missing-source counts;
- outcome horizon availability tracked separately.

For deterministic top-K/reason-ordered bounded cohorts, do not apply naive inverse-probability weighting: units with zero inclusion probability are unidentified. Such cohorts support descriptive audit of the captured subset, not universe-level counterfactual claims.

Preferred evidence hierarchy:
1. census of all otherwise-eligible research rows when storage/cost permits;
2. preregistered probability sample with recorded seed/version and non-zero inclusion probability;
3. stratified probability sample by date/regime/strategy when census is impractical;
4. bounded top-K/reason-ordered sample only for diagnostics, not causal/counterfactual estimation.

### New falsification: attribution-policy gap
Even a statistically significant conditional return difference can fail as a policy because:
- regime recognition is delayed;
- transition false positives create churn;
- strategy opportunity arrives before the regime label stabilizes;
- the regime variable duplicates trend/volatility/sector signals already inside the strategy;
- gating removes rare high-payoff recovery dates;
- extra turnover/slippage consumes the gross edge.

Therefore promotion requires net policy value versus the frozen static strategy, not merely conditional attribution significance.

### Multiplicity / overfit rule strengthened
The family of tested strategy × regime × horizon × transition-rule × weight-map combinations is one multiplicity family. A small p-value from one selected cell is not promotion evidence. First-line reporting should emphasize effect size, independent dates, uncertainty, stability and holdout performance; any multiplicity-adjusted significance is secondary to untouched OOS/forward evidence.

### Optimization decision
FORMAL_OPTIMIZATION_CANDIDATE: NONE.
Reason: contracts and falsification gates improved, but D18-06 lacks durable PIT size vintages, D18-07 lacks durable global receipts, and D16-13 lacks prospective population receipts. No regime gate/weight change is justified.

## Exact next continuation — updated
1. Audit repository for any existing durable sharesOutstanding/market-cap vintage source that can satisfy D18-06 without reconstructing history from current denominators.
2. Audit System 2 source-arrival contracts for reusable global receipt fields; if absent, keep GLOBAL_TRANSMISSION_CONTEXT UNKNOWN and specify receipt schema only.
3. Cross-check whether System 2 prospective Shadow capture already records pre-truncation population/count/order semantics; if not, formulate research-only population-receipt proposal without altering Formal Core.
4. Only after those evidence contracts exist, preregister the first static-vs-regime-policy walk-forward experiment with block/date negative controls and identical costs.
