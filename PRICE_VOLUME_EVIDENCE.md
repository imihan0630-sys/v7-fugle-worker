# Price-Volume Evidence Lane

Purpose: prospective evidence / DATA_QA after PV theory convergence at PV-200.

Formal Core: LOCKED.
PV Shadow schema: PV_SHADOW_V0_1.
All evidence below is descriptive / QA unless explicitly promoted by later governance.

# PVE-001 — Activation and First Runtime QA Receipt

## Activation run
GitHub Actions:
- workflow: `PV Shadow Class-A Enable`
- run id: 36144091642
- created: 2026-09-25 13:55 UTC / 21:55 Taipei
- conclusion: SUCCESS

Verified from job log:
- `PV_SHADOW_ENABLED=true`
- binding type = plain_text
- operation = ENABLED
- non-PV bindings preserved
- `formalIsolation=true`
- rollback not required

This proves activation succeeded and the Class-A enable guard observed unchanged Formal state.

## First read-only QA
GitHub Actions:
- workflow: `PV Shadow Class-A Read-Only QA`
- run id: 36144193465
- first attempt around 2026-09-25 21:56 Taipei
- conclusion: workflow SUCCESS

Runtime receipt:
- runtime = `8.11.0-pv-shadow-v0.1-log-only`
- pvShadowEnabled = true
- decisionImpact = false
- formalCoreImpact = false
- activeSourceHookAfterFormal = true
- ordinaryLiveCandleCallsAddedByPv = 0

D1 observability:
- D1 binding present = true
- direct D1 read = unavailable
- error = HTTP 403 / account not authorized to access D1 query service

Therefore:
workflow success != DATA_QA_PASS.

The QA report itself correctly returned:
- `qaPass=false`
- only recorded failure = `D1_DIRECT_READ_NOT_AUTHORIZED`

## First QA sample timing
At 21:56 Taipei:
- afterMarketWindow=false
- baseline rowCount=0
- snapshots row-level counts unavailable because D1 direct read unavailable
- currentAfterMarketScanDate=2026-09-24
- currentAfterMarketPvPresent=false

This was immediately after activation and before any eligible new trading-day after-market bootstrap.

Status:
ACTIVATION_VERIFIED / D1_ROW_QA_NOT_OBSERVABLE.

# PVE-002 — Holiday Negative-Control Receipt

## Re-run
The same existing read-only QA job was re-run safely after the 23:35 window:
- run id remains 36144193465, later attempt
- new job id 108293040440
- generated at 2026-09-26 07:55 Taipei
- conclusion: SUCCESS

Runtime remained:
- pvShadowEnabled=true
- decisionImpact=false
- formalCoreImpact=false
- zero extra ordinary live candle calls in PV helper

## Why 2026-09-25 after-market was skipped
Production Worker calendar explicitly contains:
- 2026-09-25 as a market holiday
- 2026-09-28 as a market holiday

The scheduled 23:35 run recorded:
- job_type=AFTER_MARKET_SCAN
- status=SKIPPED
- fugle_calls=0
- current scan stayed at 2026-09-24
- currentAfterMarketPvPresent=false

This is expected behavior, not a PV failure.

## Negative-control result
After Shadow activation on a non-trading day, the system:
- did not fabricate a new after-market scan;
- did not fabricate a PV baseline;
- did not make Fugle calls for the skipped scan;
- retained the previous valid scan date.

This is a useful outcome-blind QA success.

Status:
NON_TRADING_DAY_NO_FABRICATION_PASS.

# PVE-003 — First Natural Prospective Timing after Holiday Activation

## Bootstrap source audit
V8.11 code shows:
`bootstrapPvShadowBaselinesSafe`
runs only inside the successful after-market path after:
- Formal plan persistence;
- bridge/external delivery;
- daily push/report persistence.

Intraday `recordPvIntradayShadowSafe` does not bootstrap historical baseline on demand.

## Calendar sequence
- 2026-09-25 holiday
- 2026-09-26 weekend
- 2026-09-27 weekend
- 2026-09-28 holiday
- next ordinary eligible trading day = 2026-09-29

## Implication
### 2026-09-29 intraday
Shadow may record completed 15m snapshots for the existing monitored plan.

But because no prior after-market bootstrap has run since activation:
- same-slot baseline is expected to be missing/insufficient initially;
- such rows are DATA_QA / DATA_INSUFFICIENT observations, not H001/H002 alpha evidence.

The observed session may be rolled into the baseline at the current cron's final completed 13:00-start bar, but one session is far below the >=20 requirement.

### 2026-09-29 23:35
If the Formal after-market scan succeeds, V8.11 can bootstrap each selected/monitored Formal symbol using historical 15m candles through marketDate-1.

### 2026-09-30
Earliest natural date on which clean >=20-session intraday same-slot baselines can plausibly be available for the newly bootstrapped 9/29 Formal set.

This is the first candidate date for primary intraday PV DATA_QA, not yet alpha interpretation.

Status:
FIRST_CLEAN_BASELINE_CANDIDATE_DATE_2026_09_30.

# PVE-004 — D1 403 Is an Observability Defect, Not Evidence of Missing Runtime Rows

The QA workflow's Cloudflare token can:
- inspect Worker settings/content;
- read admin runtime endpoints.

But its direct D1 query call returns 403.

Therefore values such as:
- snapshot totalRows;
- duplicates;
- fingerprint mismatches;
- outcomes;
- D1 baseline rows
cannot currently be authoritatively audited through this workflow.

This does NOT prove those tables/rows are absent.

It proves:
`D1_ROW_LEVEL_QA_OBSERVABILITY = BLOCKED`.

## What remains observable without direct D1
Through the deployed admin readback:
- runtime version;
- current config/scan/live state;
- scan.pvShadow after successful after-market scan;
- live.pvShadow after monitoring;
- cron status.

This is enough for high-level runtime QA but not row-level immutability/duplicate/fingerprint proof.

Status:
RUNTIME_OBSERVABLE / ROW_LEVEL_D1_QA_BLOCKED.

# PVE-005 — QA Workflow Has Two Diagnostic Blind Spots

## Blind spot 1 — skipped cron reason is lost
`runAfterMarketScan(...onlyIfMissing:true)` can return:
- `reason=NOT_TRADING_DAY`
- `reason=ALREADY_SCANNED`
- `reason=AFTER_MARKET_RUNNING`

But `runScheduledWithAudit` writes:
`detail = result?.status || null`

It does not persist `result.reason`.

Therefore the cron table can show:
- SKIPPED
- detail=null

without explaining why.

The holiday diagnosis above required source-calendar inspection rather than cron receipt alone.

## Blind spot 2 — QA after-market assertion is not holiday-aware
`pv_shadow_readonly_qa.mjs` defines:
`afterMarketWindow = taipeiTime >= "23:45"`

If run after 23:45 on a holiday, it would require:
`scan.scanDate === taipeiDate`
although the correct production behavior is to skip the non-trading day.

Thus the QA script can false-fail on holidays after 23:45.

## Governance
These are research-diagnostics issues, not Formal strategy defects.

A future QA-only patch should:
- preserve cron skip reason;
- make after-market assertions trading-calendar aware.

Do not change Formal selection/BUY logic to solve this.

Status:
QA_DIAGNOSTIC_IMPROVEMENT_IDENTIFIED / NOT_IMPLEMENTED.

# PVE-006 — PVE-001 Current Readiness Decision

## Passed
- Shadow deployment present
- enable binding true
- Class-A decisionImpact=false
- Formal isolation at enable
- post-Formal source-hook ordering
- zero added ordinary live candle calls
- non-trading-day no-fabrication behavior

## Not yet passed / not observable
- D1 snapshot row counts
- duplicate-group count
- at-rest semantic fingerprint verification
- outcome fingerprint verification
- >=20 baseline rows in runtime
- first trading-day intraday coverage
- clean cohort-history provenance

## Decision
PVE-001 overall status:
`DATA_QA_PARTIAL`

Do NOT promote to:
- DATA_QA_PASS
- H001/H002 evidence
- any Formal optimization.

Next evidence hinge:
2026-09-29 trading session / after-market bootstrap,
then 2026-09-30 clean-baseline candidate session.
# PVE-007 — Admin Readback Can Verify After-Market PV, but Not Intraday Persistence

## Intraday execution order
V8.11 attaches a lightweight `result.pvShadow.session15` sidecar during analysis.

The Formal live snapshot is then:
1. built;
2. written to `v7_live_state`;
3. mirrored to KV.

Only **after** Formal signal/push/live-state persistence completes does:
`recordPvIntradayShadowSafe(...)`
run.

## Consequence
`/api/live` can expose:
- current result-level PV session15 sidecar;
- bar/session extraction state.

But it does NOT authoritatively prove:
- v7_pv_shadow_snapshots insert success;
- duplicate/mutation status;
- outcome insert success;
- baseline-table persistence.

The top-level `live.pvShadow` returned by `runBackgroundMonitor` occurs after the stored live snapshot and is not necessarily present in `v7_live_state`.

## After-market difference
The after-market scan summary is constructed after:
- bootstrapPvShadowBaselinesSafe;
- recordPvDailyShadowSafe.

Therefore `/api/scan/status` can expose:
- pvShadow.enabled;
- bootstrap requested/bootstrapped/results;
- daily stored/outcomes/details;
- zeroPvPushes/zeroPvActions;
without direct D1 SELECT.

## Evidence design
Use:
- scan/status for after-market bootstrap/daily runtime receipt;
- live/result sidecar for bar-extraction/freshness context;
- direct D1 read for row-level immutability/duplicate/outcome proof.

Status:
ADMIN_READBACK_PARTIAL / D1_REQUIRED_FOR_ROW_LEVEL_PROOF.

# PVE-008 — D1 Read 403 Is a Least-Privilege Observability Decision Point

## Observed fact
The GitHub Actions QA token can read:
- Worker settings;
- deployed Worker content;
- runtime admin endpoints.

The same token receives HTTP 403 from the Cloudflare D1 query API.

## Plausible classes of cause
- token lacks D1 read permission;
- token/account/database access scope does not cover the bound D1 resource;
- another Cloudflare authorization mismatch.

The current evidence does not distinguish these classes.

## Important separation
Worker runtime itself has a valid D1 binding and uses D1 successfully for:
- live state;
- cron records;
- leases;
- history cache.

Therefore QA-token D1 403 is not evidence that the runtime D1 binding is broken.

## Safe future options
A. grant the existing QA automation least-privilege D1 read access;
B. add a dedicated admin/read-only PV QA endpoint that queries D1 internally and returns sanitized aggregates;
C. continue using only scan/live receipts and defer row-level QA.

No option should require exposing raw secrets or mutating D1.

Status:
OBSERVABILITY_PERMISSION_GAP / RUNTIME_BINDING_NOT_IMPLICATED.

# PVE-009 — 2026-09-29 / 2026-09-30 Outcome-Blind QA Plan

## 2026-09-29 intraday
Expected:
- trading-day monitor resumes;
- pvShadowEnabled remains true;
- result-level session15 sidecar begins accumulating;
- before baseline bootstrap, core normalized fields may be DATA_INSUFFICIENT;
- no Formal behavior changes;
- no extra ordinary live candle calls from PV helper.

Pass criteria:
- monitor runs succeed;
- Formal fingerprints/behavior unchanged;
- no PV exception propagates;
- DATA_INSUFFICIENT is used instead of fabricated baseline values.

This day is **not** H001/H002 evidence.

## 2026-09-29 23:35 after-market
Expected:
- Formal scan executes rather than holiday-skip;
- scanDate=2026-09-29;
- scan.pvShadow.enabled=true;
- bootstrap requested equals eligible Formal plan count;
- each successful baseline has >=20 valid historical sessions;
- daily decisionImpact=false;
- zeroPvPushes=true;
- zeroPvActions=true.

If bootstrap partially fails:
- Formal scan remains successful;
- failed symbols remain research UNKNOWN;
- no retry logic may change Formal plan.

## 2026-09-30 intraday
Earliest candidate clean session:
- baseline from 9/29 after-market exists;
- same-slot/range/cumulative baselines can reach >=20 prior valid sessions;
- first H001/H002 DATA_QA-qualified intraday rows may appear.

Still no alpha inference until:
- clean cohort provenance;
- sample/date floors;
- row-level duplicate/fingerprint QA.

Status:
FIRST_TRADING_DAY_QA_PROTOCOL_FROZEN.

# PVE-010 — Read-Only QA Script Needs Trading-Day-Aware After-Market Assertions

## Current logic
The QA script defines:
`afterMarketWindow = taipeiTime >= "23:45"`

Then, if PV is enabled, it asserts:
`scan.scanDate === taipeiDate`.

## Failure mode
On an official holiday after 23:45:
correct production behavior is:
- no same-day scan;
- prior valid scan remains.

The QA script would incorrectly fail because it ignores trading-calendar state.

## Correct semantics
The strong same-day after-market assertions should require:
`afterMarketWindow && isTradingDate(taipeiDate)`.

On non-trading days:
verify instead:
- no fabricated same-day scan;
- skip reason/trading calendar is consistent;
- zero unwanted market calls where observable.

Status:
QA_FALSE_FAILURE_RISK_CONFIRMED / TEST_ONLY_DEFECT.

# PVE-011 — Cron Audit Loses the Reason for SKIPPED Jobs

## Current production path
`runAfterMarketScan(...onlyIfMissing:true)` returns a `reason` for skip states such as:
- NOT_TRADING_DAY;
- ALREADY_SCANNED;
- AFTER_MARKET_RUNNING.

But `runScheduledWithAudit` writes:
`detail: result?.status || null`.

## Result
A cron row can record:
- status=SKIPPED;
- skipped=1;
- detail=null;
while the actual runtime returned a useful reason.

## Research impact
Diagnosing expected holiday behavior required source-calendar inspection instead of the cron record itself.

## Desired diagnostic semantics
Preserve:
`detail = result.status || result.reason || null`

This is operational telemetry only.

Do not infer market state from missing detail.

Status:
CRON_SKIP_REASON_TELEMETRY_GAP_CONFIRMED.

# PVE-012 — PVE Evidence Provenance after Workflow Re-Run

## Authority hierarchy used
1. deployed runtime readback;
2. GitHub Actions job log;
3. production Worker source/patch semantics;
4. research checkpoint.

The evidence lane does not use:
- screenshot-only claims;
- inferred D1 row counts;
- workflow green check alone.

## Re-run method
The existing successful read-only QA job was re-run through GitHub Actions.
This avoided:
- new browser login;
- secret disclosure;
- code change;
- Cloudflare setting mutation.

The re-run produced a new QA artifact and runtime receipt.

Status:
READ_ONLY_REPRODUCIBLE_EVIDENCE_PATH_CONFIRMED.
