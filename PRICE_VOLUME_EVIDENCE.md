# Price-Volume Evidence Lane

Purpose: prospective evidence / DATA_QA after PV theory convergence at PV-200.

Formal Core: LOCKED.
PV Shadow schema: PV_SHADOW_V0_1.
All evidence below is descriptive / QA unless explicitly promoted by later governance.

# PVE-001 — Activation and First Runtime QA Receipt

## Activation run
GitHub Actions:
- workflow: `PV Shadow Class-A Enable`
- run id: 36144091642
- created: 2026-09-25 13:55 UTC / 21:55 Taipei
- conclusion: SUCCESS

Verified from job log:
- `PV_SHADOW_ENABLED=true`
- binding type = plain_text
- operation = ENABLED
- non-PV bindings preserved
- `formalIsolation=true`
- rollback not required

This proves activation succeeded and the Class-A enable guard observed unchanged Formal state.

## First read-only QA
GitHub Actions:
- workflow: `PV Shadow Class-A Read-Only QA`
- run id: 36144193465
- first attempt around 2026-09-25 21:56 Taipei
- conclusion: workflow SUCCESS

Runtime receipt:
- runtime = `8.11.0-pv-shadow-v0.1-log-only`
- pvShadowEnabled = true
- decisionImpact = false
- formalCoreImpact = false
- activeSourceHookAfterFormal = true
- ordinaryLiveCandleCallsAddedByPv = 0

D1 observability:
- D1 binding present = true
- direct D1 read = unavailable
- error = HTTP 403 / account not authorized to access D1 query service

Therefore:
workflow success != DATA_QA_PASS.

The QA report itself correctly returned:
- `qaPass=false`
- only recorded failure = `D1_DIRECT_READ_NOT_AUTHORIZED`

## First QA sample timing
At 21:56 Taipei:
- afterMarketWindow=false
- baseline rowCount=0
- snapshots row-level counts unavailable because D1 direct read unavailable
- currentAfterMarketScanDate=2026-09-24
- currentAfterMarketPvPresent=false

This was immediately after activation and before any eligible new trading-day after-market bootstrap.

Status:
ACTIVATION_VERIFIED / D1_ROW_QA_NOT_OBSERVABLE.

# PVE-002 — Holiday Negative-Control Receipt

## Re-run
The same existing read-only QA job was re-run safely after the 23:35 window:
- run id remains 36144193465, later attempt
- new job id 108293040440
- generated at 2026-09-26 07:55 Taipei
- conclusion: SUCCESS

Runtime remained:
- pvShadowEnabled=true
- decisionImpact=false
- formalCoreImpact=false
- zero extra ordinary live candle calls in PV helper

## Why 2026-09-25 after-market was skipped
Production Worker calendar explicitly contains:
- 2026-09-25 as a market holiday
- 2026-09-28 as a market holiday

The scheduled 23:35 run recorded:
- job_type=AFTER_MARKET_SCAN
- status=SKIPPED
- fugle_calls=0
- current scan stayed at 2026-09-24
- currentAfterMarketPvPresent=false

This is expected behavior, not a PV failure.

## Negative-control result
After Shadow activation on a non-trading day, the system:
- did not fabricate a new after-market scan;
- did not fabricate a PV baseline;
- did not make Fugle calls for the skipped scan;
- retained the previous valid scan date.

This is a useful outcome-blind QA success.

Status:
NON_TRADING_DAY_NO_FABRICATION_PASS.

# PVE-003 — First Natural Prospective Timing after Holiday Activation

## Bootstrap source audit
V8.11 code shows:
`bootstrapPvShadowBaselinesSafe`
runs only inside the successful after-market path after:
- Formal plan persistence;
- bridge/external delivery;
- daily push/report persistence.

Intraday `recordPvIntradayShadowSafe` does not bootstrap historical baseline on demand.

## Calendar sequence
- 2026-09-25 holiday
- 2026-09-26 weekend
- 2026-09-27 weekend
- 2026-09-28 holiday
- next ordinary eligible trading day = 2026-09-29

## Implication
### 2026-09-29 intraday
Shadow may record completed 15m snapshots for the existing monitored plan.

But because no prior after-market bootstrap has run since activation:
- same-slot baseline is expected to be missing/insufficient initially;
- such rows are DATA_QA / DATA_INSUFFICIENT observations, not H001/H002 alpha evidence.

The observed session may be rolled into the baseline at the current cron's final completed 13:00-start bar, but one session is far below the >=20 requirement.

### 2026-09-29 23:35
If the Formal after-market scan succeeds, V8.11 can bootstrap each selected/monitored Formal symbol using historical 15m candles through marketDate-1.

### 2026-09-30
Earliest natural date on which clean >=20-session intraday same-slot baselines can plausibly be available for the newly bootstrapped 9/29 Formal set.

This is the first candidate date for primary intraday PV DATA_QA, not yet alpha interpretation.

Status:
FIRST_CLEAN_BASELINE_CANDIDATE_DATE_2026_09_30.

# PVE-004 — D1 403 Is an Observability Defect, Not Evidence of Missing Runtime Rows

The QA workflow's Cloudflare token can:
- inspect Worker settings/content;
- read admin runtime endpoints.

But its direct D1 query call returns 403.

Therefore values such as:
- snapshot totalRows;
- duplicates;
- fingerprint mismatches;
- outcomes;
- D1 baseline rows
cannot currently be authoritatively audited through this workflow.

This does NOT prove those tables/rows are absent.

It proves:
`D1_ROW_LEVEL_QA_OBSERVABILITY = BLOCKED`.

## What remains observable without direct D1
Through the deployed admin readback:
- runtime version;
- current config/scan/live state;
- scan.pvShadow after successful after-market scan;
- live.pvShadow after monitoring;
- cron status.

This is enough for high-level runtime QA but not row-level immutability/duplicate/fingerprint proof.

Status:
RUNTIME_OBSERVABLE / ROW_LEVEL_D1_QA_BLOCKED.

# PVE-005 — QA Workflow Has Two Diagnostic Blind Spots

## Blind spot 1 — skipped cron reason is lost
`runAfterMarketScan(...onlyIfMissing:true)` can return:
- `reason=NOT_TRADING_DAY`
- `reason=ALREADY_SCANNED`
- `reason=AFTER_MARKET_RUNNING`

But `runScheduledWithAudit` writes:
`detail = result?.status || null`

It does not persist `result.reason`.

Therefore the cron table can show:
- SKIPPED
- detail=null

without explaining why.

The holiday diagnosis above required source-calendar inspection rather than cron receipt alone.

## Blind spot 2 — QA after-market assertion is not holiday-aware
`pv_shadow_readonly_qa.mjs` defines:
`afterMarketWindow = taipeiTime >= "23:45"`

If run after 23:45 on a holiday, it would require:
`scan.scanDate === taipeiDate`
although the correct production behavior is to skip the non-trading day.

Thus the QA script can false-fail on holidays after 23:45.

## Governance
These are research-diagnostics issues, not Formal strategy defects.

A future QA-only patch should:
- preserve cron skip reason;
- make after-market assertions trading-calendar aware.

Do not change Formal selection/BUY logic to solve this.

Status:
QA_DIAGNOSTIC_IMPROVEMENT_IDENTIFIED / NOT_IMPLEMENTED.

# PVE-006 — PVE-001 Current Readiness Decision

## Passed
- Shadow deployment present
- enable binding true
- Class-A decisionImpact=false
- Formal isolation at enable
- post-Formal source-hook ordering
- zero added ordinary live candle calls
- non-trading-day no-fabrication behavior

## Not yet passed / not observable
- D1 snapshot row counts
- duplicate-group count
- at-rest semantic fingerprint verification
- outcome fingerprint verification
- >=20 baseline rows in runtime
- first trading-day intraday coverage
- clean cohort-history provenance

## Decision
PVE-001 overall status:
`DATA_QA_PARTIAL`

Do NOT promote to:
- DATA_QA_PASS
- H001/H002 evidence
- any Formal optimization.

Next evidence hinge:
2026-09-29 trading session / after-market bootstrap,
then 2026-09-30 clean-baseline candidate session.
